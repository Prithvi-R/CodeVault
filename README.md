# CodeVault

Welcome to **CodeVault**, a repository that showcases my programming journey through various lab assignments. This collection includes code from my college labs, tracking my progress and growth in different languages and concepts over time.

## Contents

### 1. **C Programming (Semester 2 - DSA Lab) - CS111**
   - This section contains all my **C programming** files from the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** lab in Semester 2.
   - The assignments in this section cover a wide range of topics in data structures and algorithms, including:
     - **Arrays**: Implementations and operations on arrays, including searching, sorting, and other fundamental operations.
     - **Linked Lists**: Both singly and doubly linked lists, including insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.
     - **Stacks and Queues**: Implementing and manipulating stacks and queues, including applications like reversing a string or evaluating expressions.
     - **Sorting Algorithms**: Writing and optimizing common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort.
     - **Searching Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search, and understanding their time complexities.
     - **Trees**: Binary trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder), and other tree-related operations.
     - **Tries**: Implementing tries for efficient string storage and retrieval, especially useful for tasks like dictionary lookups and autocomplete features.
     - **Graphs**: Representation of graphs (adjacency matrix/list), graph traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), and other graph-related problems.
     - **Heaps**: Implementing heaps (min-heaps, max-heaps) and understanding their applications in priority queues and heap sort.
   - Each of these assignments demonstrates my understanding of how data structures work and how algorithms are applied to solve real-world problems. These exercises are foundational in my journey toward becoming proficient in C programming.


### 2. **Java Programming (Semester 3 - Java Lab) - CS202**
   - This section contains my **Java programming** assignments from the **Java lab in Semester 3**.
   - Throughout this section, you’ll find code that focuses on the core principles of Java, including:
     - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The implementation of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
     - **Exception Handling**: Writing robust Java code with try-catch blocks and handling exceptions effectively to ensure program stability.
     - **File Handling**: Techniques for reading from and writing to files in Java, including working with file streams, buffers, and serialization.
     - **Java Collections Framework**: Working with collections like Lists, Sets, and Maps to efficiently store and manipulate data.
   - These assignments helped me master key Java concepts and put them into practice through real-world applications. The knowledge gained here laid the groundwork for more advanced Java topics.

### 3. **Python - Graph Visualization**
   - This section features a **Python script** where I built a **graph** to help with classwork. It was designed for entertainment and to make learning more interactive.
   - This was entirely developed by me to visualize data in a fun and easy-to-understand way, aiming to simplify the concepts for my class.

## About CodeVault
**CodeVault** serves as a digital archive of my academic journey, helping me keep track of all the assignments and code I’ve written. Over time, I’ll continue to add and refine my work as I progress through different courses and topics.
