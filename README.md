# CodeVault

Welcome to **CodeVault**, a repository that showcases my programming journey through various lab assignments. This collection includes code from my college labs, tracking my progress and growth in different languages and concepts over time.

## Contents

### 1. **C Programming (Semester 2 - DSA Lab) - CS111**
   - This section contains all my **C programming** files from the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** lab in Semester 2.
   - The assignments in this section cover a wide range of topics in data structures and algorithms, including:
     - **Arrays**, **Linked Lists**, **Stacks and Queues**: Basic data structures and their operations.
     - **Sorting Algorithms**: Writing and optimizing common sorting algorithms.
     - **Searching Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms and understanding their time complexities.
     - **Trees**, **Tries**, **Graphs**, **Heaps**: Advanced data structures and traversal techniques


### 2. **Java Programming (Semester 3 - Java Lab) - CS202**
   - This section contains my **Java programming** assignments from the **Java lab in Semester 3**.
   - Throughout this section, you’ll find code that focuses on the core principles of Java, including:
     - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
     - **Exception Handling & File Handling**
     - **Java Collections Framework**: Working with collections like Lists, Sets, and Maps to efficiently store and manipulate data.

### 3. **Python - Graph Visualization**
   - This section features a **Python script** where I built a **graph** to help with classwork. It was designed for entertainment and to make learning more interactive.
   - This was entirely developed to visualize data in a fun and easy-to-understand way, aiming to simplify the concepts for my class.

## About CodeVault
**CodeVault** serves as a digital archive of my academic journey, helping me keep track of all the assignments and code I’ve written. Over time, I’ll continue to add and refine my work as I progress through different courses and topics.
